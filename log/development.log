По умолчанию является пятиместным автомобилем, но за доплату можно заказать третий ряд сидений. Как и прежде, покупателям доступно множество вариантов оформления экстерьера и интерьера: Design Pure Experience, Design Pure Exellence, M спортпакет и индивидуальный.  Кроме этого, третья генерация модели улучшила свои аэродинамические показатели, а также стала просторней. Багажник отныне вмещает 650 литров поклажи, а со сложенными задними сиденьями — 1 870 литров, что на 30 и 120 литров соответственно больше, чем у предшественника.  Впервые BMW X5 будет предлагаеться не только в полно-, но и заднеприводном исполнении. Тем не менее модификация, которую в движение приводят исключительно задние колеса, в продаже появилась с декабря 2013. Сперва на рынке были представлены две дизельные и одна бензиновая версия:      BMW X5 xDrive30d с рядной трехлитровой «шестеркой», максимальная мощность и крутящий момент которой увеличились до 258 л.с. и 560 Нм (+13 л.с., +20 Нм). Время разгона до «сотни» сократилось до 6,9 секунды (-0,7 с), а средний расход топлива уменьшился до 6,2 литра (-1,2 л);      BMW X5 M50d — спортивная версия, разработанная подразделением M Performance. В качестве силовой установки использует шестицилиндровый дизель с тройным наддувом. Аппетит трехлитрового агрегата уменьшился, а динамика слегка улучшилась. В смешанном цикле мотор потребляет 6,7 литра «тяжелого» топлива (-0,8 л). Спринт от 0 до 100 км/ч занимает 5,3 секунды (-0,1 с). При этом отдача двигателя осталась прежней — 381 л.с. и 740 Нм;      BMW X5 xDrive50i — бензиновая «восьмерка» стала на 10% мощнее и на 16% экономичней. Мотор объемом 4,4 литра отныне выдает 450 л.с. (+43 л.с.) и 650 Нм (+50 Нм). До ста километров в час модель выстреливает на полсекунды быстрее предшественника — за 5 с. При этом средний расход сократился до 10,4 литра (-2 л).  В декабре 2013 список модификаций пополнили бензиновая BMW X5 xDrive35i (306 л.с.), дизельная BMW X5 xDrive40d (313 л.с.), а также две версии мощностью 218 л.с. — полноприводная BMW X5 xDrive25d и заднеприводная BMW X5 sDrive25d. В паре со всеми моторами используется восьмидиапазонный автомат.  Механизм системы постоянного полного привода стал легче и быстрее. Впервые визуальная информация о работе системы xDrive будет отображаться на мониторе. Среди новшеств и проекционный дисплей, который стал цветным и кроме основных приборных показателей научился отображать список контактов и другую полезную информацию.  В обычном исполнении кроссовер оснащается системой Driving Experience Control, имеющей несколько стандартных режимов езды: Comfort, Sport, Sport+ и Eco. Каждый из них меняет отклик педали газа, алгоритмы работы коробки передач, настройки усилителя руля. Кроме этого, за доплату для полноприводных модификаций доступны несколько вариантов адаптивной подвески, которые позволят водителю дополнительно настраивать под себя и амортизаторы:      Comfort — обеспечивает максимальный комфорт, сзади устанавливаются пневмоэлементы;      Спортивная M-подвеска — заниженная и более жесткая подвеска (стандарт для BMW X5 M50d);      Dynamic — ходовая, обеспечивающая более динамичное прохождение поворотов;      Professional — так называемая «золотая середина». Способствует динамичной езде без ущерба для комфорта. По сути объединяет в себе варианты Comfort и Dynamic.  В стандартную комплектацию BMW X5 входят электропривод крышки багажника, мультимедия iDrive с Bluetooth и USB, комплексная система стабилизации движения, круиз-контроль с функцией автоматического торможения, двухзонный климат-контроль, автозатемняющееся салонное зеркало заднего вида.  Список многочисленных опций включает светодиодные противотуманки, полностью светодиодные адаптивные фары, панорамную крышу, премиум-акустику от фирм Harman Kardon и Bang & Olufsen, 20-дюймовые колесные диски, а также длинный перечень электронных помощников, в том числе автопарковщик и систему Stop & Go, которая позволяет автомобилю на скорости до 40 км/ч двигаться без участия водителя. При этом «автопилот» отныне не только следит за расстоянием до впереди идущей машины, но и за разметкой, подруливая таким образом, чтобы автомобиль всегда оставался по центру своей полосы.
